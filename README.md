# ammcoChallenge
This is Roderick de Leon's approach to Ammco's Coding assignment.

On your Facebook account, you have friends who all have a list of movies that they like. Write a function that returns the most popular movie of a person in his/her network of friends. Network means that you have to consider friends of friends as well.
